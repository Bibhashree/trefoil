                    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
                        <p>Our environment faces several problems and many of these seem to be 
                        worsening with time, bringing us into a time of a true environmental 
                        crisis. Therefore enhancing public awareness of these problems is essential 
                        to lessen their detrimental effects. Environmental pollution is increasing 
                        day by day and imposing severe and irreversible damage to the world. It is 
                        of different types: air, water, soil, noise, light, etc.<br>
                        Urbanization and technological development have put the survival of the planet 
                        in danger by degrading the quality of the environment's essential elements—air, 
                        water and soil—due to the release of hazardous waste from factories like plastics, 
                        heavy metals, nitrates, burning of fossil fuels, acid rain, oil spills and 
                        industrial toxins. Urbanization and overpopulation have increased city noise and 
                        light pollution. Polluting agents are exponentially increasing in modern society, 
                        disturbing the ecological balance and posing extinction problems for different 
                        animal and bird species. This is because the destruction of plants, especially 
                        trees, by acid rains disturbs the natural environment of animals. The effect of 
                        pollution on the health of human being is well known, but it is a dire need to 
                        understand the link between environmental pollutants and mental health.<br>
                        In terms of strategies to solve the upcoming issues regarding environmental 
                        health, planning followed by action should be considered as a ground base for the 
                        manifestation of desired results in this direction.
                        </p><br>
                    <h2>Environmental pollution: causes, effects, and the remedies</h2>
                    <p>Environmental pollution is not a new phenomenon, yet it remains the world's 
                        greatest problem facing humanity, and the leading environmental causes of 
                        morbidity and mortality. Man's activities through urbanization, 
                        industrialization, mining, and exploration are at the forefront of global 
                        environmental pollution. Both developed and developing nations share this 
                        burden together, though awareness and stricter laws in developed countries 
                        have contributed to a larger extent in protecting their environment. Despite 
                        the global attention towards pollution, the impact is still being felt due to 
                        its severe long-term consequences. This chapter examines the types of 
                        pollution—air, water, and soil; the causes and effects of pollution; and 
                        proffers solutions in combating pollution for sustainable environment and 
                        health.</p>

                    <h2>Reducing Pollution</h2>
                    <p>Reducing pollution is possible; it is something that is being done at an 
                        intergovernmental level, for example, with the many climate summits, despite 
                        sluggishness and uncertainty.<br>
                        In actual fact, companies are setting goals that go beyond institutional ones: 
                        in the energy sector, the most advanced companies are moving to an electricity 
                        generation fleet increasingly based on clean sources, which are now fully 
                        competitive, thanks to technological innovation, particularly in materials 
                        science.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p class="b1">Individuals and communities can also play an important role in reducing environmental
                pollution: for example, by favoring travel by public transportation (especially rail), 
                paying to the sorting of waste, reducing energy consumption, as well as, of course, 
                avoiding dispersing plastics or other polluting materials into the environment.<br>
                The responsibility is everyone's, the importance is paramount and the mission is 
                possible: namely, to curb all forms of anthropogenic pollution to protect human health, 
                natural ecosystems and the environment in general.</p>
